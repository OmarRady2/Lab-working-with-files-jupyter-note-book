# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# in this notebook we are going to talk about Data science (tools, languages, libraries, Objevtives) used in the course

# some of the popular data science languages are:
# 1- python                                                                                                                       
# 2-R                                                                                                                             
# 3-SQL                                                                                                                           
# 4-julia                                                                                                                      
# 5-JAVA                                                                                                                             
# there is more like javascript, C, GO, Scala and many more

# most used libraries in data science are:  
# matplotlib, pandas, ggplot, kers, Tensorflow, SciPy, NumPy, and many more

# most used data science tools are:                                                                                                   
# Apache Spark, Jupyter, Apache Hadoop and many more

# ###  some artihmetic expressions in python
# 4 + 4  for addition
# 
# 4 - 4  for subtraction
# 
# 4 / 4  for dividing 
# 
# 4 * 4  for Multiplication
# 
# 4 % 4  for mod
# 

# In[1]:


# trying arithmetic expression
(3*4)+5


# In[3]:


#converting 200 minutes to hours
(200/60)
